## Project Overview
This project is a personal portfolio project that I have been crafting to enhance my hands on development skill
in front end frameworks including responsive design, smoother animation and transitions. As I have had previous experience in Vue and Nuxt, I asked myself, "Hey, Why not explore another new stack just to check out the pros and cons of each framework?".
This project explains a lot about how I got exposed into different stacks and how I started out in the digital industry.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
